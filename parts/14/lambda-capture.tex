\subsection{Lambda Capture Expressions}

\problemtitle

When we are defining a lambda, we have the possibility to capture
variables of the enclosing scope such that they become available in
the body of the lambda \aref{lambdas-internals}. In practice, such
variables are either copied (like \code{var1} below, due to the
\code{=} syntax), or referenced (like \code{var2} below, with the
\code{\&} syntax).

\begin{lstlisting}
const auto foo = [=var1, &var2]() -> void {};
\end{lstlisting}

Unfortunately there is no other variant of the capture, which leads to
situations like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
void wait_for_new_players(const std::string& group)
{
  std::string display_label = group + ": ";

  // Copies are striking again. Here display_label is copied into a
  // field of the function object associated with this lambda; not
  // moved nor initialized on construction.
  auto add_player_to_list =
    [display_label](player_id id, const std::string& player alias)
    {
      m_player_list->add(id, display_label + alias);
    };

  m_team_service.wait_for_players(group, add_player_to_list);
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, we would want to avoid the copy of the display
label into the equivalent member variable of the lambda. In \cpp11
there is only two ways to achieve that: either by creating the display
label in the callback's body, thus creating a new string on each
call\footnote{We would also have a copy of the captured group variable
anyway.}, or by using a custom function object, \cpp98-style.

Additionally, we can note that this behavior prevent any use of a
move-only type for a captured variable, such as
\code{std::unique\_ptr}. Indeed, there is no way to move the variable
from the outer scope into the lambda.

\solutiontitle

In \cpp14, capture lists have been extended to allow the initialization
of a variable by an expression. We can use that to initialize the
display label with the final string directly:

\begin{lstlisting}
void wait_for_new_players(std::string group)
{
  // display_label is initialized directly in the construction of the
  // lambda, thus saving a copy.
  auto add_player_to_list =
    [@\emcode{display\_label = group + ": "}@]
    (player_id id, const std::string& alias)
    {
      m_player_list.add(id, display_label + alias);
    };

  m_team_service.wait_for_players(group, add_player_to_list);
}
\end{lstlisting}

This also solves the move-only type situation since we can now move the
variable:

\begin{lstlisting}
void apply_filter(std::vector<int>& values, std::unique_ptr<filter> filter)
{
  std::for_each
    (values.begin(), values.end(),
     [@\emcode{f = std::move(filter)}@](int& v) -> void
     {
       v = f->transform(v);
     });
}
\end{lstlisting}
