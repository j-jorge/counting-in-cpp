\subsection{Number separator}
\label{number-separator}

\problemtitle

Long numbers are hard to read. Check how long you need to get the
numbers in this \cpp11 code:

\begin{lstlisting}
int wisconsin_population = 5822434;
int california_population = 39512223;
\end{lstlisting}

My guess is that you grouped the digits by three in your mind in order
to get the numbers right. Didn't you? Usually when we write large
numbers like that, we group the digits with a separator to make the
numbers easier to read, like in 1'234'567.

Since \cpp14 we can use this syntax in the code:

\begin{lstlisting}
int wisconsin_population = 5'822'434;
int california_population = 39'512'223;

// It works with float numbers too.
const float f = 1'111.222'222;

// And also with for non-decimal numbers. Funny thing, the quote can
// appear anywhere between two digits.

const unsigned mask = 0xfff'0'00'ea;
\end{lstlisting}
