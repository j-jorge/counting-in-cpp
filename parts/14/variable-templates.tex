\subsection{Variable Templates}

Up to \cpp11, the only things that could be templated were types and
functions. So if you had a variable whose value was dependent on a
template parameter, you had to wrap the variable in a type. Take for
example this code that computes the number of bits set to 1 in a
constant at compile time:

\lstinputlisting{examples/variable-template/main-11.cpp}

Starting with \cpp14, all the types in the above code can be removed
and replaced by a much more concise template variable, which also
carries the intent more accurately.

\lstinputlisting{examples/variable-template/main-14.cpp}

Note than in this specific case a constexpr function
\aref{sec:constexpr} is more suited to the task; plus it can also be
called at run time.

You will probably not see many variable templates in the wild, as they
are quite a niche feature. Mostly, they are used to store some
domain-specific constants to the precision of a given type.
