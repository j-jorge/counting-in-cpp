\subsection{Defaulted Constructors}

\problemtitle

Let's continue with constructors. Before \cpp11, each class would have
implicit constructors unless stated otherwise. One example of a
situation where an implicit constructor would not have been created
was the explicit declaration of a custom constructor by the
programmer. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct foo
{
  foo(int) {}
};

int main()
{
  foo f1;     // fail
  foo f2(24); // ok
  foo f3(f2); // ok

  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, \code{foo} has no default constructor (but has
an implicit copy constructor). In order to have the default
constructor, the programmer had to implement one. The main problem
becomes maintenance: when new fields are added in the class, we have
to remember to update the constructor to initialize them.

\solutiontitle

Starting with \cpp11, the programmer can tell the compiler to
implement the constructor with what would have been the default
implementation if it was not deleted.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct foo
{
  foo()@\emcode{ = default}@;
  foo(int) {}
};

int main()
{
  foo f1;     @\emcode{// ok}@
  foo f2(24); // ok
  foo f3(f2); // ok

  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
