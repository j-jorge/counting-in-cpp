\subsection{\code{std::nullptr\_t} and \code{nullptr}}

\problemtitle

The traditional way to set a pointer to zero before \cpp11 was via the
\code{NULL} macro. So what would happen if we tried to compile the
following program?

\lstinputlisting{examples/nullptr/nullptr-98.cpp}

Did you expect the program to compile well and \code{foo(int*)} to be
called? Too bad, we are in a good old ambiguous call situation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
error: call of overloaded ‘foo(NULL)’ is ambiguous
\end{lstlisting}

Since \code{NULL} is often defined as the integral value zero, the
compiler cannot distinguish it from an integer. Thus the error.

As an answer to this problem, \cpp11 introduces the \code{nullptr}
keyword, which exactly represents a zero pointer. Its type is
\code{std::nullptr\_t} and it is implicitly convertible to any
pointer. Consequently, the code below compiles as expected.
