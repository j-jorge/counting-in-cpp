\subsection{\code{constexpr}}
\label{sec:constexpr}

Let's say we have some complex computation, like for example counting
the number of bits set to one in an integer:

\begin{lstlisting}
int popcount(unsigned n)
{
  return (n == 0) ? 0 : ((n & 1) + popcount(n >> 1));
}
\end{lstlisting}

What happens when we want to be able to call this function both with
run-time values and compile-time constant as arguments? In the code
below we would want the size of the array to be a constant, but as it
is written its size will be computed at run-time, which makes it a non
constant-sized array, which is not standard compliant.

\begin{lstlisting}
int main(int argc, char**)
{
  int array[popcount(45)];
  printf("%d\n", popcount(argc));

  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

A typical solution for this problem is to implement the computation
via template classes and meta-programming:

\lstinputlistinghl{28}{examples/constexpr/constexpr-98.cpp}

This implementation works but has two major problems: first it is
incredibly verbose, second it forces us to implement the same
algorithm twice, respectively for run time and compile time
computations, doubling the risk of bugs and errors.

\bigskip

The \code{constexpr} keyword introduced in \cpp11 allows us to use the
same implementation for both compile-time and run-time computations.

\lstinputlistinghl[emph=constexpr]{10}{examples/constexpr/constexpr-11.cpp}

This keyword can be applied to a variable or a function to explicitly
tell the compiler that it can and should be computed at compile-time
when it appears in constant expressions. It is for example totally
possible to call the \code{constexpr popcount()} function as a
template argument, like in \code{popcount<popcount<42>{}>()}.
