% Changes between C++11 and C++14
% http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1319r0.html

\Cpp14 is frequently qualified as a bugfix version of \cpp11, indeed
most features are improvements or extensions of things introduced in
the latter.

Nevertheless, it does not mean that these improvements are not worth
it. Let's see.

\section{At the Language Level}
\input{parts/14/number-separator}
\input{parts/14/binary-literals}
\input{parts/14/deprecated}
\input{parts/14/generic-lambdas}
\input{parts/14/lambda-capture}
\input{parts/14/return-type-deduction}
\input{parts/14/variable-templates}
\input{parts/14/decltype-auto}
\input{parts/14/relaxed-constexpr}

% Mergeable allocations are left out as I could not find a compiler
% where this optimization is implemented.

\section{In the Standard Library}
\input{parts/14/make-unique}
\input{parts/14/integer-sequence}
\input{parts/14/exchange}
\input{parts/14/tuple-addressing-by-type}

% standard user defined literals
% heterogeneous lookup in associative containers
% enable_if_t (type aliases)
% quoted
